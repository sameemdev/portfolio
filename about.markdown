Here, I share tips, insights, and things I’ve explored and tested around securing Microsoft 365 environments and general cybersecurity. It’s a space where I document what I’ve learned, experiment with different approaches, and reflect on practical ways to keep digital tools and data safer. While it’s more of a personal interest than professional work, I hope these notes and experiments can be useful to others who are curious about cybersecurity.
